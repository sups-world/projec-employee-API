# projec-employee-API

This is an employee records app

#description
This application asks for name,date of birth,gender,salary and stores them in a database.I have used NodeJs as web server and ExpressJS as the framework.
For the database I have used PostgreSQL.
I have created endpoints for CRUD operations on the employee records.
For now this app is capable of adding new records and view all records.
In the future I hope to develop frontend features to edit and delete records as well.

#Installation
This app can be run locally. 
.env variables need to be changed accordingly
